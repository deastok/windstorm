## Windstorm

A modern storm chasing / weather dashboard.

### Why
I've always been interested in meteorology and the weather. Part of that was watching movies like Twister, The Day After Tomorrow, and Sharknado.
As I've watched videos of storm chasers, I noticed that the software they use for tracking the storms and displaying critical information
looks choppy and outdated. So as a personal project, I want to make a more modern and fast storm chasing app to improve the QoL of the people who risk
their lives to provide valuable information for us all. Hopefully this project can help the lives of those who save ours.

### Build
```
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
